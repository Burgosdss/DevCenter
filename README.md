## `Welcome to DevCenter`

DevCenter was created in order to help users have less clutter open on their tabs. Three General Assembly students Diego Burgos, Dominique Hosea, and Austin Ferrin wanted to create an App that would allow the users to authenticate with other applications and then be able to use some base functionality of those sites via a third party API.
